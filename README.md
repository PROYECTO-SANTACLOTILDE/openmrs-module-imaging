OpenMRS Imaging Module
======================
In order to improve the management of patient image data within OpenMRS, the open source electronic healthcare system,
we have developed an integration between Orthanc PACS and OpenMRS, initially designed for OpenMRS 2.x, the most widely used version of OpenMRS.
The first release for OpenMRS 3.x is available (## link to npm release 3), the next generation electronic medical record (EMR) system. This new module is focused on
simplifying the management of imaging data.

Watch the video demonstration of the module here: [![Watch the video]()](https://youtu.be/no3WNaq4Q_M)

This diagram illustrates the workflow of the worklist. A radiologist wants to view the worklist generated in OpenMRS via C-FIND Rest API
URL. The Orthanc server forwards the request to OpenMRS. OpenMRS processes the request and returns the worklist in JSON format. The Orthanc plugin function ``Onworklsit``
reads the data and generates the worklist in DICOM format. The results can be viewed with the command like ``findscu -v -W -k "ScheduledProcedureStepSequence[0].Modality=CT" 127.0.0.1 4242``. 
When the radiologist performs the procedure, a new DICOM study is created and uploaded to the Orthanc server. The Orthanc plugin observes the new study using the 
OnChange function, notifies OpenMRS to update the worklist status and marks the associated procedure step as completed.

# Preparing Othanc servers

The following is needed:

- An OpenMRS 2 backend server
- One or multiple Orthanc servers

## Deploying the imaging module

Download our imaging backend OMOD module from https://github.com/sadrezhao/openmrs-module-imaging/releases, copy it to the module directory of your OpenMRS backend server, 
and start the server or OpenMRS is up and running, you can upload the new module (imaging-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.omod) using the 'Add or Upgrade Module' option in Manage Modules.
Please note that the upload may take some time. If deployed successfully, it should appear in the list of loaded modules on your server:

![The imaging module](omod/src/main/webapp/resources/images/imagingModule.png)

Deploy OpenMRS Imaging module from it's directory by cloning the repository, navigating to the directory and running the following run command. This will automatically
deploy the module before the server is started. To streamline the process, add the following run configuration to your IDE to efficiently build, deploy and run the project.:

```bash
  mvn clean install openmrs-sdk:run -DserverId=myserver
```

## Configure the connection to the Orthanc servers
You must provide connection settings (IP address, username, etc.) in order to allow OpenMRS to reach the Orthanc server(s). If the imaging module 
has been correctly deployed, you can access the connection settings on the administration page of your OpenMRS server:

![Orthanc server configuration](omod/src/main/webapp/resources/images/orthancConfiguration.png)

## Configure your Orthanc servers

The imaging backend module provides an REST API service that the Orthanc servers need to contact to query and update the worklist. 
Add the following lines to the configuration file of the Orthanc servers (typically the file `/etc/orthanc/orthanc.json`):

```bash
    "ImagingWorklistURL": "http://OPENMRSHOST:OPENMRSPORT/openmrs/ws/rest/v1/worklist/requests",   
    "ImagingUpdateRequestStatus": "http://OPENMRSHOST:OPENMRSPORT/openmrs/ws/rest/v1/worklist/updaterequeststatus",`
    "ImagingWorklistUsername" : "OPENMRSHOSTUSER",`  
    "ImagingWorklistPassword" : "OPENMRSHOSTPASSWORD"`
```
Replace OPENMRSHOST and OPENMRSPORT by the address and port of your OpenMRS backend server, and OPENMRSHOSTUSER and OPENMRSHOSTPASSWORD 
by the name and password of an user account on the OpenMRS server that you have created for the Orthanc servers.

## Install the worklist plugin on the Orthanc servers:

The Orthanc servers act as worklist servers for the modalities. Our python plugin for Orthanc implements the needed functionality. Download 
the python script from https://github.com/sadrezhao/openmrs-module-imaging/blob/main/python/orthancWorklist.py and place it in a directory 
that is accessible by the Orthanc servers, for example in `/etc/orthanc`. Then add the following line to the python plugin configuration file 
of Orthanc (typically the file `python.json` in `/etc/orthanc`):

```bash
  "PythonScript": "/etc/orthanc/orthancWorklist.py",
```
Then restart the Orthanc server:

```bash
  sudo systemctl restart orthanc
```

## Image Data Management
This is the heart of the Orthanc integration, allowing browsing and viewing of patient images through DICOM viewers available within Orthanc.
The module retrieves the metadata of image studies stored on Orthan servers. A mapping function helps associating OpenMRS patient records with their
corresponding studies. In addition, image data can be uploaded directly from the OpenMRS web client to Orthanc servers.

## Worklist without RIS
In the context of radiology, a worklist is a list of imaging studies or tasks that a radiologist needs to execute, review, or analyze.
These tasks are typically retrieved from a radiology information system (RIS), a specialized database that manages patient and imaging information.
However, in situations where an RIS system is not available or feasible (such as for smaller healthcare facilities, clinics, or specific locations),
a simple radiology worklist can be sufficient.

The Orthanc servers also act as DICOM worklist servers. Imaging procedure requests created in the frontend can be queried by modalities or the 
radiology department from the Orthanc servers. When a DICOM study matching the ``PerformedProcedureStepID`` tag of a worklist procedure step is uploaded
to an Orthanc server, the Orthanc server will notify the OpenMRS server and the status of the procedure step will change in the frontend.

### Testing the worklist
First, create some new imaging requests in the front end. The DCMTK findscu tool from https://support.dcmtk.org/docs/findscu.html allows to query the resulting 
DICOM worklists from the Orthanc server (replace 127.0.0.1 by the IP address of the Orthanc server):

```bash
  findscu -v -W -k "ScheduledProcedureStepSequence[0].Modality=CT" 127.0.0.1 4242     # Query by modality 

  findscu -v -W -k "PatientID=PatientUuid" 127.0.0.1 4242  # Query by patient data

  findscu -v -W -k "ScheduledProcedureStepSequence[0].RequestedProcedureDescription=xxx" 127.0.0.1 4242 # Query by requested procedure description
```

If you want to generate a `.wl` file, uncomment the following lines from the python plugin:

``` bash
# This code only for test:`
  # Save the DICOM buffer to a file`
  # with open("/tmp/worklist_test.wl", 'wb') as f:
  # f.write(responseDicom)`
```
