OpenMRS Imaging Module
======================
To improve the management of patient imaging data within OpenMRS, an open-source electronic healthcare system, we have developed an integration between Orthanc PACS and OpenMRS. Initially designed for OpenMRS 2.x — the most widely used version. We have also created a microfrontend-based user interface that is powered by the core OpenMRS backend. This interface focuses on simplifying and streamlining the management of imaging data. The first version of the module for 3.x is available on npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zhaosadre/esm-patient-imaging-app.
